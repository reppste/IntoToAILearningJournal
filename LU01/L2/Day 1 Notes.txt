Prompt Engineering- making a short efficient prompt to get everything you need from an output from AI
Prompt- Any input given for an AI to produce an output
Shorter responses that give you everything needed to make AI cheaper to use
Give clear concise prompts with context
AI can be wrong don't just fall into "You're holding it wrong" mentality where it's just the user's fault

Start prompt with task
	Give AI who you are or what it is being made for
	Give the way it needs to be output

Follow with context
	Good: give me some ideas for a birthday present. Under $30
	Great: Give me 5 ideas for a birthday present with a budget of $30 dollars. The gift is for a 29 year old who loves winter sports. Recently switched from snowboarding to skiing.

Give reference
	Additional input data or ideas

Evaluate Output from AI

Iterate
	Go back and fix errors

Break down into different steps
This provides better outputs than trying to do it all at once.

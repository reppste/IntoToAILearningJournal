Virtualization
Used to break up a big machine into smaller machines
Used for security
Not every piece of software can run on all software
Creates a software base 
Hypervisor makes virtualization possible
Pulls resources from hardware to virtualize different software
Type 1 hypervisor is installed on top of the server
Type 2 hypervisor has a layer of host OS between the physical and hypervisor
We will work with type 2 hypervisor
Used for end user
Using VirtualBox today
Has higher latency because it's not directly connected to the server
Use hypervisor to build virtual machines
You can use VMWare to run software you don't trust and it won't affect your physical server
You can run different OS on different VMs
Portable
Host is the physical computer
Virtual machine cuts resources in half
VM is weaker than host
GPU cannot be passed through to VM
Cannot copy and paste into VM unless you change it

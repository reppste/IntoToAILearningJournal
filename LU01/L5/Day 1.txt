What hardware is?
Any physical piece of equipment to make a computer function

Starts with motherboard connects everything together

Desktops have socketed CPU
CPU thinks

Everything else that thinks connects to CPU through PCIe slots
example - GPU, wifi card, nvme storage

PSU - converts power from wall outlet to give computer power

RAM - really fast, temp storage, expensive
ECC - error corrcting code
Non-ECC - not error correcting (cheaper)

Storage
HDD - has disk that spins
SSD - faster, no disk that spins, has 2 forms

Expansion Drives
Network Cards
GPU- does everything CPU doesn't, physics, AI, video processing, does a lot of small tasks fast
VRAM - Faster than normal RAM

Raspberry Pi- Credit Card Computer

More linux propaganda

mkdir - makes a directory
cd - goes into that directory

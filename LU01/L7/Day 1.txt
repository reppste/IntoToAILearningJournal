Got Svelte and Node.js downlaoded
started with Svelte, just a couple basics


// creates project folder in directory
npx sv create (insert filename)


// creates new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app

// starts the server to open the app and follow along while making edits
npm run dev

// starts the server and opens the app in the web browser
npm run dev -- --open

AI can have more knowledge on a topic
AI is lazy
Can prefer to fix errors by just deleting what's wrong
Can produce solutions that break the functionality
Can create it's own methods and libraries that don't exist and therefore won't work.
Can be fed references to make AI function better
Another pitfall is security risks
Cannot copy and paste proprietary code into online AI chatbots
Most companies have local AI models
AI is great at fixing syntax errors
AI is great with patterns
AI is fairly good with logical errors
But the bigger the problem and the more complex it is, it can struggle a lot and can set you wrong
AI is trained and knows what the most common solutions are for problems

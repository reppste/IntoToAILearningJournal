Worked on Pair vibe coding assignment.

The first and second days we worked on implementing 2 of our own features before passing it off to the next group
We had it all done by the end of the first class.
The second day we went over it and made sure it worked properly.
The third day we passed it off to another group and received one back.
We fixed some bugs that were present and implemented 2 more features into the program.
